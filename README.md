# Suspending all work on this project likely indefinitely (unless something changes)
- Why? well...
- Making description for perks is way to much for me i hate doing that and its big part of extension with out them i don't see point in continuing
- I have asked if anyone wants to help me with this many times but no one was willing to do it
- If people care so little why i should spend my time making this for them
- I made this project because of 2 reasons
1. I like programing
2. And i wanted to help people
- Thats it i guess
