This is a browser extension aimed to add stats like in-game range in meters, reload time in seconds, and more
# Common question: does this work on mobile:
Short answer: Yes
Long answer: Yes it would work if you find a way to install the extension to browsers like firefox I looked into installing and it was too much work for me to care about at the moment but then I will upload it to the Firefox store it will be simple installation
# Will I upload this to extension stores:
Yes at some point I will it's too much hassle to do that and I am way too lazy to deal with that and chrome store is asking me to pay 5$ fuck that ...
# Instalation
First of all grab one of releases on the right side 
Then extract contents of the folder and depending on browser fallow installation instructions
# Chrome: 
Paste this "chrome://extensions/" in the address bar without quotes than on top right press "Developer mode" and on to left "load unpaced" select folder extracted earlier and you done
# FireFox:
First of all, I don't recommend using Firefox because you will need to add an extension every time you open Firefox (basically if you close Firefox you will need to add an extension again)
Installation Paste this "about:debugging#/runtime/this-firefox" in the address bar without quotes then press "Load temporary extension" and select file called "manifest" in extracted folder
# Other browsers:
Browsers like Opera, Chromium, Microsoft Edge, and other Chromium based browser will be very similar to chrome
