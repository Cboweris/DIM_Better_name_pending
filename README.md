# Latest update: I'm to lazy to work on this alone it takes to much time updates will be rare if i update at all

# Suspending all work on this project likely indefinitely (apparently indefinitely is one day)
- Still looking for help with perks its very easy to do i am just way to picky for me perfect or nothing that is problem if someone else would do it i wouldn't care as much
- Why? well...
- Making descriptions for perks is way too much for me I hate doing that and it's a big part of extension without them I don't see the point in continuing
- I have asked if anyone wants to help me with this many times but no one was willing to do it
- If people are so lazy they can't even copy paste some text then ....
- And they care so little why I should spend my time making this for them
- I made this project because of 2 reasons
1. I like programming
2. And I wanted to help people
- That's it I guess
