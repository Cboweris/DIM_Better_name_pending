# Clarity, A DIM Companion
- Clarity expands upon the capabilities of Destiny Item Manager (DIM) by providing new features and better descriptions.

# Features

- In-Game Range, Reload Speed, Ready Speed, and Stow speed calculators for weapons
- DIM Dark Mode with custom color options
- Improved Recoil Direction Display
- UI reworks
- Additional features are constantly in the works (Join our [Discord Server](https://d2clarity.page.link/discord) for more details)

# Where can I download Clarity?
- Clarity is available for Chrome and other Chromium-Based Browsers like Opera, Microsoft Edge, and Brave here: [Clarity, A DIM Companion](https://d2clarity.page.link/chrome)
- You might have to allow external browser store downloads on some Chromium-Based browsers so just click the button/popup and you should be fine.
- We recommend using the [Beta version of DIM](https://beta.destinyitemmanager.com) for the latest features available. 

- We plan to rerelease Clarity on the Firefox Store at a later date but until then, we suggest using it with a different, Chromium-based browser like Edge as a downloaded browser application. Here's how to do that:
  - Add the extension to **Microsoft Edge** from the [Chrome Web Store](https://d2clarity.page.link/chrome)
  - Go to the [Beta DIM website](https://beta.destinyitemmanager.com) and log in.
  - Click the button at the end of the Addres Bar to install DIM as an application. Alternatively, go to **Edge Settings** (three horizontal lines on the top right), select **"Apps"** in the menu, and click **"Install Destiny Item Manager"**.

# Does Clarity have mobile support? - No
- We do not support mobile devices currently but would love to eventually have a standalone application. Unfortunately, we simply do not have the time and resources for that at the moment so don't get your hopes up.

# Manual Installation
- Join our [Discord Server](https://d2clarity.page.link/discord)
- The latest version and the Installation Guide can always be found there.
- New releases always come out with a small delay on the Chrome Web Store so that is where you can grab the new updates earlier.
- You can also grab the latest version [here](https://github.com/Ice-mourne/Clarity-A-DIM-Companion/releases). It will be the file called **'Source code  (zip)'**.
