# Clarity, A DIM Companion
- Clarity expands upon the capabilities of Destiny Item Manager (DIM) by providing new features and better descriptions.

# Features
- Extremely detailed Perk and Mod descriptions
- In-Game Range, Reload Speed, Draw Speed, and Stow speed calculators for weapons
- DIM Dark Mode with custom color options
- Improved Recoil Direction Display
- UI reworks
- Additional features are constantly in the works (Check the [Discord](https://d2clarity.page.link/discord) for more details)

# Can i get this extension on my browser store? - Yes, on the Chrome Web Store
- Clarity is available for Chrome and other Chromium-Based Browsers like Opera, MS Edge, and Brave here: [Clarity, A DIM Companion](https://d2clarity.page.link/chrome)

# Does Clarity support mobile? - No
- Unfortunately it doesn't work on mobile ever since we lost access to our firefox Developer account.
- We would love to support mobile devices but we do not want to mess with the Firefox store again so a dedicated mobile app would be preferred. But we simply don't have the time and resources for that at the moment so don't get your hopes up.

# Manual Installation
- Join our [Discord Server](https://d2clarity.page.link/discord)
- The latest version and the Installation Guide can always be found there.
- New releases always come out with a delay on the Chrome Web Store so here is where you can grab them the earliest.
- In case you don't want to join discord you can get maybe the latest version [here](https://github.com/Ice-mourne/Clarity-A-DIM-Companion/releases) file called 'Source code(zip)'
- I'm just bad at keeping everything updated
