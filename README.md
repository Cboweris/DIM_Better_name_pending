# Clarity, A DIM Companion
- Clarity expands upon the capabilities of Destiny Item Manager (DIM) by providing new features and better descriptions.

# Features
- Extremely detailed Perk and Mod descriptions
- In-Game Range, Reload Speed, Draw Speed, and Stow speed calculators for weapons
- DIM Dark Mode with custom color options
- Improved Recoil Direction Display
- UI reworks
- Additional features are constantly in the works (Check the [Discord](https://d2clarity.page.link/discord) for more details)

# Can I get this extension on my browser store? - Yes, on the Chrome Web Store
- Clarity is available for Chrome and other Chromium-Based Browsers like Opera, MS Edge, and Brave here: [Clarity, A DIM Companion](https://d2clarity.page.link/chrome)

- We might rerelease Clarity on the Firefox store later but until then, we suggest using it with a different, Chromium-based browser like Edge as an application.
 - Add the extension to Edge from the Chrome Web Store, go to the DIM website and log in. After doing that, go to Edge Settings (three horizontal lines on the top right), select "Apps" in the menu, and click "Install Destiny Item Manager".

# Does Clarity support mobile? - No
- Unfortunately, it doesn't work on mobile ever since we lost access to our Firefox Developer account.
- We would love to support mobile devices but we do not want to mess with the Firefox store again so a dedicated mobile app would be preferred. But we simply don't have the time and resources for that at the moment so don't get your hopes up.

# Manual Installation
- Join our [Discord Server](https://d2clarity.page.link/discord)
- The latest version and the Installation Guide can always be found there.
- New releases always come out with a delay on the Chrome Web Store so here is where you can grab them the earliest.
- In case you don't want to join Discord you can get maybe the latest version [here](https://github.com/Ice-mourne/Clarity-A-DIM-Companion/releases) file called 'Source code(zip)'
- I'm just bad at keeping everything updated
