# Does Clarity support mobile? - No
- Unfortunately it doesn't work on mobile ever since we lost access to our firefox Developer acccount.
- We would love to support mobile devices but we do not want to mess with the Firefox store again so a dedicated mobile app would be preferred. But we simply don't have the time and resources for that at the moment so don't get your hopes up.
