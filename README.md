# Clarity, A DIM Companion
- Clarity expands upon the capabilities of Destiny Item Manager (DIM) by providing new features and better descriptions.

# Features
- Extremely detailed Perk and Mod descriptions
- In-Game Range, Reload Speed, Draw Speed, and Stow speed calculators for weapons
- DIM Dark Mode with custom color options
- Improved Recoil Direction Display
- UI reworks
- Additional features are constantly in the works (Check the [Discord](https://d2clarity.page.link/discord) for more details)

# Can I get this extension on my browser store? - Yes, on the Chrome Web Store
- Clarity is available for Chrome and other Chromium-Based Browsers like Opera, MS Edge, and Brave here: [Clarity, A DIM Companion](https://d2clarity.page.link/chrome)

- We might rerelease Clarity on the Firefox Store at a later date but until then, we suggest using it with a different, Chromium-based browser like Edge as a downloaded browser application. Here's how to do that:
  - Add the extension to **Edge** from the [Chrome Web Store](https://d2clarity.page.link/chrome), go to the [DIM website](https://beta.destinyitemmanager.com) and log in. After doing that, go to **Edge Settings** (three horizontal lines on the top right), select **"Apps"** in the menu, and click **"Install Destiny Item Manager"**.

# Does Clarity support mobile? - No
- Unfortunately, it doesn't work on mobile ever since we lost access to our Firefox Developer account.
- We do not support mobile devices currently but would love to eventually have a standalone application. Unfortunately, we simply do not have the time and resources for that at the moment so don't get your hopes up.

# Manual Installation
- Join our [Discord Server](https://d2clarity.page.link/discord)
- The latest version and the Installation Guide can always be found there.
- New releases always come out with a small delay on the Chrome Web Store so that is where you can grab the new updates earlier.
- You can also grab the latest version [here](https://github.com/Ice-mourne/Clarity-A-DIM-Companion/releases). It will be the file called **'Source code  (zip)'**.
